    <h3>Project</h2><hr>
<h4>Offline Signature Verification With AE-CNN Hybrid Algorithms For Fake Signature Detection</h4>
<p>
•This project involved developing a Fake Signature recognition system by using deep learning and Convolutional Neural networks. The system extracts features from Signature images and incorporates contextual information to enhance accuracy. Designed for real-world adaptability to unseen Fake Signatures</p>
<p>
•I implemented a transfer learning model in Python to classify between Fake Signature, and Original Signatures and validated its effectiveness on novel images and Applied AutoEncoder-CNN hybrid feature extraction approach encompasses several critical steps for data pre-processing and image augmentation to optimize model performance.and it achieved high accuracy</p>
